   <!-- Inline lements = It takes only that much space which is required or suffience for a word or sentence means limited space they will take. like anchor(a) tab etc...

   block elements  = It takes the whole width , either you write a single word or a single sentence , it will cover the whole width . for ex <p></p> p tag etc.   -->

   <p>Hello I am a new developer.</p>

   <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a> the one people use hr and br tag will use the one tag effectively and the will not face any kind of problems regarding this so I am just willong that you are not just alone use p and br tag instead of br and hr tag cuz they are block elements and the tag which occupy only 10 spaces are inline one so dont confuse in this... both are same but I also want to add few more things that you are not alone that you are undertaking this agreement , the peoples who were carrying forward also need some support in the paragraph and br tag , the one you will 


   <!-- In the output , you can clearly see that paragraph tag is occupying full width as it is a block element 
   whereas , anchor tag(a) google is occupyingonly that musch space of word which means it is a inline element.  -->

   <div>I am a Block element </div>
   <span>I am a Inline element</span>


   see the output...
